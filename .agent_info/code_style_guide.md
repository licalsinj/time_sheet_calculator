# Coding Style Guide

## Interactions
When fixing an issue or implementing a new feature please tell me how to test it. Both happy path and edge cases to test. Doesn't have to be extensive (i.e. leave out "launch the app" but should be descriptive of the feature implemented)

## Commenting Code
When commenting the code make sure to use the following rules: 
Comment the code so that someone who's never coded can understand them. 
All functions should have doc strings with args, returns, and raises. 
All function signatures should have type hints. 
Do not use excessive decorators on your comments, emojis, and don't speak in first or second person. 
Do not change any of the programming logic. 

## Markdown 

For To Do lists in markdown use bracketed checkboxes like this: 

``` markdown to do list
Example To Do List: 

- [ ] Example Incomplete Item
- [x] Example Completed item
- [ ] One more incomplete item
```
