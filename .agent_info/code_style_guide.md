# Coding Style Guide

## Commenting Code
When commenting the code make sure to use the following rules: 
Comment the code so that someone who's never coded can understand them. 
All functions should have doc strings with args, returns, and raises. 
All function signatures should have type hints. 
Do not use excessive decorators on your comments, emojis, and don't speak in first or second person. 
Do not change any of the programming logic. 

## Markdown 

For To Do lists in markdown use bracketed checkboxes like this: 

``` markdown to do list
Example To Do List: 

- [ ] Example Incomplete Item
- [x] Example Completed item
- [ ] One more incomplete item
```
