# Coding Style Guide

## Commenting Code
When commenting the code make sure to use the following rules: 
Comment the code so that someone who's never coded can understand them. 
All functions should have doc strings with args, returns, and raises. 
All function signatures should have type hints. 
Do not use excessive decorators on your comments, emojis, and don't speak in first or second person. 
Do not change any of the programming logic.
