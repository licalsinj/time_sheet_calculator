ABOUT_MARKDOWN = '# Time Sheet Calculator\n\nWelcome! This app helps you track weekly hours, see time remaining to reach 40, and estimate your Friday clock-out based on what you enter.\n\n## Quick start\n1. Enter start and end times for Monday–Thursday (e.g., `8:00 AM`, `5:00 PM`).\n2. Enter lunch minutes (e.g., `60`). Leave blank to auto-assume 60 minutes (you will see a yellow warning).\n3. Enter Friday start (or leave blank to assume `8:00 AM`).\n4. Click **Calculate** or press **Enter** to update totals, hours-to-40, and Friday clock-out.\n\n## Assumptions & defaults\n- Friday start defaults to **8:00 AM** if you leave it blank.\n- Lunch defaults to **60 minutes** if blank. You will see a yellow highlight and warning.\n- Times are normalized as you move between fields (e.g., `8` becomes `8:00 AM`).\n- Rounding is to quarter hours for totals.\n\n## Errors & warnings\n- **Red** borders and messages: invalid time formats (e.g., `25:00`, `asdf`), end before start, or negative/non-numeric lunch.\n- **Yellow** borders and messages: assumed lunch defaults.\n- Errors and warnings stack; fix inputs and press **Calculate** again to clear them.\n\n## Handy shortcuts\n- **Tab** to move between fields quickly.\n- **Enter** triggers Calculate.\n- Clear a field to remove its value; Friday will still estimate if enough data is present.\n\n## Need help?\n- Check the project README for install/build guidance.\n- Open an issue on the project’s GitHub to report problems or request support.\n'
